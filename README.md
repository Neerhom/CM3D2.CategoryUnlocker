# CM3D2.CategoryUnlocker
Sybaris Patcher that adds new menu categories and model slots.


!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!!!
In the unlikely even of this patcher becoming incompatible with the game or one wants to uninstall, ALL savefiles saved with this patcher active will be trated by the base game as invalid! 
Luckily, this is not critial, because CM3D2 save editor exists(just google it). Canvert the save file to .json, remove all references to added categoris (they are right after ones of seieki_ashi), and convert it back.
