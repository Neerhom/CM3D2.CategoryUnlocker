Sybaris Patcher for unlocking addition categories.

Unlocks additional categories, that while not used, were not cut out from the game, and ads them under Clothing tab.
The unlocked categories are of Item type, and intended have no specific purpose, i.e. anything goes.

List of caegories and associated model slots:

seieki_ashi - seieki_ashi

seieki_face - seieki_face

seieki_hara - seieki_hara

seieki_hip - seieki_hip

seieki_naka - seieki_naka

seieki_mune - seieki_mune

seieki_ude - seieki_ude
  
Because these are inteded to be generic purpose categories, the provided del menus also have support for tattoo and moles.
You can find more info on supported layers in the menu files themeselves.

There are two basic mods to support the patcher, so the unlocked categories won't be entirely empty.
The mods are: 
  Free color nail and toenails both with versions to use any of available color sets. The nails can be found in S_ASshi and toenails in S_Face.
   My toon skin. Can be found in S_Hara.
